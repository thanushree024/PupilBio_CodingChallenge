# Subtask 1a - Coverage Analysis

## Objective

In this subtask, we will perform a coverage analysis on a dataset containing phased methylation patterns (PMPs) across different tissue types. Specifically, it calculates the single CpG coverage for each sample and computes the median and coefficient of variation (CV) for the coverage of CpG sites in various tissue types.

## Data Overview

The data used in this analysis is stored in the `PupilBioTest_PMP_revA_task1.csv` file, which contains the following columns:

- `Tissue`: Tissue type (Tissue #1 or Tissue #2).
- `CpG_Coordinates`: The coordinates of the CpG sites.
- `Strand` : Indicates the DNA strand (‘f’ or ‘r’).
- `Methylation Status` : Eight possible patterns (‘000’ to ‘111’).
- `Sample ID` : Unique identifier for each sample.
- `Replicate` : Indicates technical replicates. 

## Approach
1. Load the necessary libraries in R
2. Loading the dataset
3. Inspecting the dataset
4. Checking column names
5. Calculating the single CpG coverage
6. Grouping Data by Tissue Type and Calculating Statistics
7. Output
