# Subtask 1a - Coverage Analysis

## Objective

In this subtask, we will analyze the coverage of CpG sites across various tissues. We will calculate the coverage as the number of occurrences of each CpG site for each tissue and compute the median and coefficient of variation (CV) for each tissue.

## Data Overview

The data used in this analysis is stored in the `PupilBioTest_PMP_revA_task1.csv` file, which contains the following columns:

- `Tissue`: Tissue type (Tissue #1 or Tissue #2).
- `CpG_Coordinates`: The coordinates of the CpG sites.
- `Strand` : Indicates the DNA strand (‘f’ or ‘r’).
- `Methylation Status` : Eight possible patterns (‘000’ to ‘111’).
- `Sample ID` : Unique identifier for each sample.
- `Replicate` : Indicates technical replicates.
