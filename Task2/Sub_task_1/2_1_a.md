## Quality Control
This subtask demonstrates the quality control (QC) steps for analyzing raw sequencing data in FASTQ format. The dataset consists of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) samples, including one sample from normal tissue and one from cancer tissue. The primary goal is to evaluate the quality of these sequencing reads, which is crucial for downstream analysis such as alignment and variant calling.

## Data Overview

File Format: *FASTQ*

Samples:
1. `PA221MH-lib09-P19-Tumor_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`
2. `PA221MH-lib09-P19-Tumor_S2_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz`
3. `PA221MH-lib09-P19-Norm_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`
4. `PA221MH-lib09-P19-Norm_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz`

Tool Used: `FastQC` and `MultiQC`

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the quality control, ensure you have the following tools installed:

***FastQC***: A tool for checking the quality of raw sequencing data.

***Browser***: To view FastQC HTML reports

## Running FastQC on NGS Data
Bioinformatic analysis begins with quality control of sequence data to ensure its reliability and accuracy. This step helps identify potential errors, contamination, or issues that may have occurred during sequencing or the experiment. Using tools like FastQC, the sequencing files are analyzed to assess their quality and ensure they meet the required standards for downstream analysis.

## Command to Run FastQC for the Samples
``` bash
mkdir fastqc_reports  # Create a directory for the reports
fastqc
PA220KH-lib09-P19-Tumor_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
PA220KH-lib09-P19-Tumor_S2_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
PA221MH-lib09-P19-Norm_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
PA221MH-lib09-P19-Norm_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
-o Fastqc_results/
```
## Expected Output Files

For each FASTQ file, FastQC will generate:

`HTML Report`: A human-readable report summarizing the quality metrics. 
[Reports available here](https://github.com/thanushree024/PupilBio_CodingChallenge/tree/main/Task2/Sub_task_1/Reports)


`.zip File`: A compressed archive containing detailed analysis data.


## HTML reports
HTML report contains following modules:
### 1. Basic Statistics: 

This module provides a concise summary of the sequencing data, highlighting key metrics essential for assessing data quality. 

The summary includes:

#### - File Encoding Type: 
Specifies the encoding format used for the sequencing file (e.g., Sanger, Illumina 1.8+).

#### - Number of Sequences: 
Total number of reads present in the sequencing file.

#### - GC Content Percentage: 
Proportion of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in the sequences, expressed as a percentage.

These metrics are critical for understanding the overall quality and characteristics of the sequencing data before proceeding with downstream analysis.


### 2. Per base sequence quality:
This module evaluates the sequence quality at each base position using a BoxWhisker plot, with scores represented on the Phred scale. The per-base quality metric is crucial for assessing the reliability of individual base calls across the read length.
A Phred score of 30 or higher at each position is recommended, representing a 99.9% base call accuracy, which is typical for high-quality sequencing data.


### 3. Per sequence quality scores
This module provides a summary of the overall quality score for each sequence, allowing users to assess the general reliability of the dataset. Typically, the majority of sequences should have a quality score of 30 or higher, indicating high base call accuracy.


### 4. Per base sequence content:
This module provides an analysis of the per-base sequence content, which is used to assess the nucleotide distribution across all positions in the read. In a typical random library, the sequence content should be relatively uniform across all bases.


### 5. Per sequence GC content:
This module analyzes the GC content across the entire sequence, comparing it to a modeled normal GC distribution. The GC content is an important metric as it provides insight into the overall composition of the sequence, which can be used to assess potential biases or issues in the data.

### 6. Per base N content:
This module reports the per-base N content, which refers to the proportion of base calls that are reported as N. In sequencing data, an N represents an indeterminate base call, meaning that the sequencer was unable to confidently assign a nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) at that position.

### 7. Sequence Length Distribution:
This module analyzes the distribution of sequence lengths across the dataset. Ideally, in high-quality sequencing data, the lengths of the sequences should be uniform, meaning that most of the sequences should have similar lengths, with minimal variability.

### 8. Sequence Duplication Levels:
This module reports the proportion of duplicated sequences within the dataset. Duplicated sequences often arise from PCR amplification during library preparation, which can cause overrepresentation of specific fragments in the final sequence data.

### 9. Overrepresented sequences: 
This module identifies overrepresented sequences in the dataset and attempts to determine their potential source. Overrepresented sequences are sequences that appear more frequently than expected, which could be a sign of contamination or a highly duplicated region in the genome.

### 10. Adapter Content:
This module detects adapter contamination, which refers to the presence of adapter sequences in the sequencing data. These sequences, which are typically introduced during library preparation, can be mistakenly included in the final sequencing results if they are not properly removed.
